3DPong

dampersand

This is an experiment with the SFML SDK to create a 3DPong style game.  The game itself is a watered-down clone of curveball, a flash game on the web.

The project is currently as-complete-as-I-want-it, meaning I may SOMEDAY come back and add a pretty gui, hash out the playing field, create a user-friendly button for increasing difficulty, etc (or add the ability to create an acceleration by spinning the ball)... but for now, I've gotten what I wanted out of the project - practice with SFML and proof-of-concept of the game itself.
